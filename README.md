# DS3FlverFixer
A Tool built for Dark Souls 3 which will fix GX Lists and Buffer Layouts to make sure they match with the materials used by the flver meshes.
## Usage
Drag any Dark Souls 3 dcx onto the executable that contains a flver or multiple flvers.

It will not create a new dcx, the original dcx will be replaced.
